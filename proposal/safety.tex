Special safety considerations must be taken into account if the bouldering wall is to be constructed next to the wood workshop. In particular, an internal organization should be created within OIST of individuals who wish to access the wall. Individuals in this organization should be briefed on basic safety for using the bouldering wall and being around the woodworking equipment, but do not need training in the usage of the equipment. Individuals who have not been trained in basic safety should not be granted access to the bouldering wall. To separate the bouldering wall and wood workshop, the space  between the wood workshop area and the bouldering wall should be separated by a line. We must further discuss these plans with the members of the wood workshop to effectively utilize the shared space.
